Welcome to ryokan, a poorly named app that scrapes and stores property listings from Japanese real estate websites.


I have no idea how version number conventions are so even this will be updated with time

##v0.01 (19/08/2022)

- Added basic functionality to scrape properties from ieichiba.com
- This will only scrape the first 10 properties from each prefecture because I haven't written code to loop through pagination yet
